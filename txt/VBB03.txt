13;For my buddy Galvan,
13;I'm glad we've grown to be such
13;close friends.  For all the time you
13;put in to learn, and the effort you
13;put forth to make the audio what it is,
13;I thank you.
13;For hounding me about the worst film I know,
13;'TITANIC'... burn in hell.
13;Let's make a film,
13;Go Wings,
15;Brady
