15;For my wife Michelle,
15;Your constant support and understanding
15;is like none I've ever known.
15;For 2 1/2 years you stood by me and lifted me
15;up during the most challenging period of my life.
15;For all of this, I cannot repay you.  I can only
15;promise a return to a normal life... a
15;sane husband... and you're best friend.
15;All my love,
15;Brady
