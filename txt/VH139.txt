14;On October the 3rd, 1989,
29;I sat on a wooden bench in the waiting room in Washington, DC.
25;A government panel put me on the stand.
05;
14;As my name was read out,
15;the sessionroom went silent.
20;I walked up the aisle towards the stand.
15;I was being called to account.
23;But I had no clear explanation to give.
