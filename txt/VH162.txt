21;I met a traveler from an antique land,
36;who said,"two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert
33;Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies
32;whose frown and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
29;Tell that its sculptor well those passions read, Which yet survive,
17;stamped on these lifeless things,
31;The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed,
03;
27;And on the pedestal, these words appear:
25;My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings,
25;Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
18;Nothing beside remains.
19;Round the decay of that colossal Wreck,
42;boundless and bare, The lone and level sands stretch far away."
